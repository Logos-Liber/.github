# Logos Liber

**The word, freely rendered.**

An open-source ecosystem for collective intelligence — where knowledge flows freely from thought to form.

---

## The Ecosystem

| Project | Domain | Role | Status |
|---------|--------|------|--------|
| **[Generous](https://generous.works)** | generous.works | Universal canvas for streaming generative UI | Active |
| **[Galaxy Brain](https://galaxybrain.info)** | galaxybrain.info | Universal knowledge management system | Active |
| **Agents of Empire** | — | AI agent management game GUI | In Development |
| **Monumental Systems** | — | Orleans actor framework for distributed execution | In Development |

Backed by the **[Decentralized Intelligence Agency](https://decentralizedintelligence.agency)** — a 501(c)(3) scientific nonprofit dedicated to increasing collective intelligence.

## How It Connects

```
Human Intent
    ↓
Galaxy Brain structures the knowledge
    ↓
Monumental Systems executes the agents
    ↓
Agents of Empire visualizes agent state
    ↓
Generous renders results as live, interactive UI
    ↓
Human Insight
```

This is not a pipeline. This is a loop. Each layer feeds back into the system, creating a continuously improving cycle of collective intelligence.

## Values

**Radically Open Source** — Not "open core." Everything is open. The code, the data models, the infrastructure patterns. MIT licensed.

**Free Speech Maximalism** — Ideas must flow without artificial constraint. We build infrastructure that respects the right to speak, create, and reason freely.

**Decentralization Over Concentration** — Intelligence should be distributed, not hoarded. Knowledge should be accessible, not gatekept.

**Generosity as Default** — The default is to give, not to gate. We contribute to the commons.

---

## Etymology

**Logos** (Greek: λόγος) — Word. Reason. The rational order underlying reality.

**Liber** (Latin) — Book. Free. The Roman god of creative freedom.

Together: *The free word. The book of reason. Knowledge unbound.*
